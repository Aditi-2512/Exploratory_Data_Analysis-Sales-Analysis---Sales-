# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Sales-Analysis

Set of real-world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

# BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
In this code, we have used Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months of Sales Data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by Cleaning our Data. The tasks during this section include - 
- Drop NaN values from our dataframe.
- Change the type of columns ( to_numeric , astype )
- Find and remove rows which have 'or' in them

 Once we have cleaned up our Data , we move to the Data Exploration section. In this section we explore 4 High-Level Business Questions related to our Data 
 - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
 - Which US City had the highest number of sales ?
 - What products are most often sold together ?
 - What product sold the most ? Why do you think it sold the most ?

 To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
 - Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
 - Using the GroupBy Method
 - Using the apply() method and lambda function
 - Visualizing our results with the help of Bar Charts and Line Graphs
 - Importing itertools and collections to create dictionary and count the ocuurences of elements in the list
 - Labelling our graphs
